# Response to Joshua Blumenstock's 2018 article

Blumenstock addresses and discusses some of the unanticipated effects and pitfalls that are resultant from the fast-paced development occurring in the big data analytics field. Much of the issues here are a result of a lack of legislation and oversight due to the nature of the relatively slow government bureaucracy that fails to keep up. In addition to this, Bloomenstock discusses the challenges associated with analyzing how the effectiveness of new and novel solutions. One disturbing example is how people were able to exploit the humanitarian aid efforts by pretending to live in thatched houses. It can be challenging to factor in these unexpected outcomes that result from the new forms of data analysis and resultant action. 

All this considered, Bloomenstock is advocating for the furtherance and continued development for the field of Data Science and the many positive implications it can have on our modernizing world. However, he desires to clearly state some of the many factors that will need to be considered to truly optimize the genuine positive intent and impact of this research and data collection.

# Notes Taken During Reading Article
What is the promise of data science as it relates to human development? What are some pitfalls?

- 95% of the global population has mobile phone coverage
- Earth Imaging Company "Planet" makes high-resolution satellite pictures freely available for aid organizations to coordinate relief efforts. 
- World Bank and United Nations recruit data scientists to apply their skills for international development.
- We are losing track of the key hardships.
- Machine learning algorithms can detect patterns that may not always be obvious.
- The same technology that was used to generate credit scores can be used to generate high-resolution maps of crop yields and potentially even detect malnutrition. 
- Analysts estimate that the wealthy benefit more than the poor in 1/4 of all interventions aimed at reducing poverty. 
- In 1996 only 8% of tens of millions of dollars reached the neediest citizens. 
- Unanticipated Effects, solutions enabled by big data often bolster those who are already empowered rather than vulnerable people. 
- Not everyone benefits from being able to borrow money. 
- A study in Rwanda found only 51% of borrowers were aware of the interest rate. 
- Semi-authoritarian regimes can misuse data. 
- Common methods of data collection involve surveys and interviews. They are imperfect.
- The flaws of these new approaches are not well understood. Risk deploying tools that have not been adequately tested. 
- Patterns detected in one place do not always generalize
- When people become aware that their data is being monitored to make decisions, they are going to try and game the system.
- The most disadvantaged people tend to be the least represented in new sources of digital data. 
- Not having a Facebook account can mean you aren't included in the data
- Legislation is intended to limit both the government and companies abuse of power. 
- Big data could transform international development.. and IS transforming international development. 

Key Points:
Unanticipated Effects, Lack of Validation, Biased Algorithms, Lack of Regulation, Need to Deepen Collaboration.
