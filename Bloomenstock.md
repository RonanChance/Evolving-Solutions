What is the promise of data science as it relates to human development? What are some pitfalls?

- 95% of the global population has mobile phone coverage
- Earth Imaging Company "Planet" makes high-resolution satellite pictures freely available for aid organizations to coordinate relief efforts. 
- World Bank and United Nations recruit data scientists to apply their skills for international development.
- We are losing track of the key hardships.
- Machine learning algorithms can detect patterns that may not always be obvious.
- The same technology that was used to generate credit scores can be used to generate high-resolution maps of crop yields and potentially even detect malnutrition. 
- Analysts estimate that the wealthy benefit more than the poor in 1/4 of all interventions aimed at reducing poverty. 
- In 1996 only 8% of tens of millions of dollars reached the neediest citizens. 
- Unanticipated Effects, solutions enabled by big data often bolster those who are already empowered rather than vulnerable people. 
- Not everyone benefits from being able to borrow money. 
- A study in Rwanda found only 51% of borrowers were aware of the interest rate. 
- Semi-authoritarian regimes can misuse data. 
- Common methods of data collection involve surveys and interviews. They are imperfect.
- The flaws of these new approaches are not well understood. Risk deploying tools that have not been adequately tested. 
- Patterns detected in one place do not always generalize
- When people become aware that their data is being monitored to make decisions, they are going to try and game the system.
- The most disadvantaged people tend to be the least represented in new sources of digital data. 
- Not having a Facebook account can mean you aren't included in the data
- Legislation is intended to limit both the government and companies abuse of power. 
- Big data could transform international development.. and IS transforming international development. 

Key Points:
Unanticipated Effects, Lack of Validation, Biased Algorithms, Lack of Regulation, Need to Deepen Collaboration.
