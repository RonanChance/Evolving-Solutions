## Important Stuff

How can we maximize the use of geospatial data to broader our developmental capabilities. Can we tackle social infrastructure and land challenges before they arise? How do we factor these into our strategy of growth?

This case study was conducted in a fringe area of Ulaanbaatar. They identified the geographical factors that were implicit in the increase in the development of the city. Most importantly they addressed how geographical factors were less important than social infrastructure. These conclusions are important in plans for future development. It is expensive to produce and prepare photographs for GIS data. However, these high-resolution satellite images have allowed us to analyze surfaces much more closely. Very High Resolution (VHR) data is used for analysis in the study.

In Mongolia, nomads claim land by building wooden fences to mark their territory around what is often a ger. Land reform laws in the early 2000s allowed individuals to obtain formal and legal rights to certain areas. During the timespan between 2003 and 2008, photographs were taken of the area and then digitized into vector formats. Spatial layers could then be identified from the imaging and marked as either Main Roads, Roads, or Private Land. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate urban expansion. Noted was the change in private land plots which increased dramatically. Land plots tend to be built most near land occupied and even to a small extent, near water kiosks. Using this obtained data, certain areas can be identified for future development because of estimates that predict the likelihood of development.

With this knowledge, urban planners should act preemptively to manage any potential future side effects of expansion. Amartya Sen's places a heavy emphasis on the social aspects of a healthy and productive existence. This data could be utilized to benefit future expansion efforts and give people more consistently reliable access to water and other social benefits. This addresses Sen's argument that development should measure and encompass a decent standard of living. There is complexity here because mostly the city has developed naturally and without foresight. However, this data allows future order to be created from the inherent initial chaos.
