### How did the transformation of the City of God provide evidence for how social networks were central to Rio de Janeiro's urbanization during the 60s, 70s, and 80s?

The City of God, a place where drug trafficking, police brutality, and diabolical acts of inhumane treatment are rampant. This movie tells the story of Rio de Janeiro in the 60s, 70s, and 80s and the social dynamics that were implicit in causing the violence and corruption. The slums of the city become increasingly violent over the years, and the innocent citizens are caught in a crossfire between the competing drug gangs. Brazil soon is considered the "world's most violent nation not in a state of war". The question then remains, what caused Brazil to evolve into this chaos?

Lil' Ze, later known as Lil' Dice, is an insatiable drug lord who goes on a killing spree to eliminate all of his rivals. The tagline of the movie is important in understanding this character- "If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you." Lil' Ze is the only one who arguably defeats this fateful proverb because he is the beast. He is a product of the worst aspects of humanity and goes on to become the most successful drug trafficker in the city. Ironically, because he murders so many people and takes over their operations, violence in the Rio de Janeiro diminishes greatly as the faction wars are almost nonexistent. 

Rocket, our narrator, is a significantly more peaceful character who does not dream of drug-running or power. His dream is to be a photographer. He walks a dangerous path, as he is surrounded by the toxicity and violence, but is majoritively able to avoid the group’s pressure. He determines to avoid this lifestyle and that he will find a way to run from the beast. In a sense, he becomes a beast of his own as he seeks to get an internship and to expose the corruption that exists behind the scenes. 

Knockout Ned is a handsome ladies man who is not involved in a life of crime. Out of spite, Lil’ Ze rapes Ned’s girlfriend and kills members of his family. This is a disturbing and graphic part of the story, and in turn, Ned joins forces with Carrot with the war against Lil’ Ze’s drug empire. This series of events accentuate the power of evil’s ability to quickly destroy the few good-hearted individuals in Rio. 

Hierarchical structures exist almost everywhere in nature, it seems to almost be a sort of governing law in the organization of species. As Brazil transitioned from an authoritarian structure to democracy, there was no reduction in the drug and gang-related violence. It had become so deeply ingrained and a systemic issue, that much of the government officials were corrupted by its presence. Some would argue that the expansion of the drug empires was similar to that of a fractal’s growth. However, I believe that it was more akin to that of a pathogenic spread. Much like Geoff West proposed, people are only separated by at most 6 degrees. In the case of an interconnected city like Rio de Janeiro, most likely much less. With this in mind, nearly every individual had some connection to problematic underpinnings to the society of drug dealing. 

There lies an overabundance of greed and willingness for great evil in the human condition. It is because of these qualities that societies require an effective democratic government without corruption, and where there can be a peaceful transition of power. Tobler’s first law of geography illustrates how connected things are in relation to their distance. The truth is that everything is more connected than we are built to understand. We do not fully appreciate how urbanization has revolutionized the complexity behind every action, and this is why the drug trafficking empire was so pervasive and destructive in Rio de Janeiro’s urban expansion. Perhaps the new era of big data we are entering will allow for more sophisticated ways of extinguishing this kind of disarray and violence.
