### Mongolia’s Dynamic Future - The Necessity for Geospatial Analysis

The land of the eternal blue sky, expansive Gobi desert, and Bogd Khan mountains faces numerous complex development issues. Rapid urbanization in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar has resulted in severe degradation to the standard of living and encouraged the growth of poorly planned areas around the city fringes. In consequence, major issues in air quality, water pollution, and a lack of infrastructure are evident. With 45% of the entire Mongolian population living in Ulaanbaatar, and 32% of the population living below the poverty line, there is a dire need for effective urban planning and sustainable development. It is these challenges that have inspired the central research question: How can geospatial data be utilized to discern the factors and covariates most correlated with urban expansion, and how can fractals be useful in predictive modeling? Mongolia’s uniquely migratory and temporary population clashes with the significantly more static and permanent style of city living in Ulaanbaatar. As nomadic families began to settle down in the city, the urban growth rate had been significant in the fringe areas of the city. Logistic Regression and Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) models have been able to give key insights into the resulting issues. With these methods in mind, our future research goal is to incorporate Geoff West’s fractals and concepts of scale into models that can predict, rather than solely model growth. The potential for a more holistic understanding of development is possible as individuals turn from almost exclusively self-sufficient entities to building communities of shared values and mutually sustainable life. There lies an opportunity to follow this dynamic population geospatially to find more universal development variables that could be harnessed for generalized predictive models. Mongolia has a significant landmass, varied terrain, and a topography conducive to geospatial data collection.
