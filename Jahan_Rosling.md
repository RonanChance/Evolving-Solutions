## UNDP and Gapminder

### Question: 
Selim Jahan introduces the idea that for far too long the paradigm of economic development has dominated the idea of human development. Jahan states that while income is critical it is not an end, and that human development is about expanding the richness of life, not the richness of the economy within which human beings live. What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development. What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

### Response:
Hans Rosling states that “we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change” and proceeds to provide several examples. What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth? What was Rosling’s warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?
In the pursuit of human development, there is a common misconception that economic development is the primary measurement for success. Jahan discusses the necessity of measuring and focusing on a variety of other aspects of life. For example, he explains how health development precedes and is necessary for economic development. The Human Development Index places emphasis on three key tenants of development: a long and healthy life, attainment of knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Jahan believes these to be more accurate and important measurements of what constitutes success in the development of the world. In addition to this, the Ted Talk by Rosling explains the essential aspects of other social changes that must take place in the pursuit of development. One major factor is gender equality in holistically bettering society. Finally, Rosling explains how important it is that we use discernment in our endeavors to improve our world. Often averages can cloud our view of the real inequalities in society. If we are going to succeed, we must understand that our efforts must be tailored specifically to each portion of the world on a very detailed level. 

## General Notes:

### What is human development? (Selim Jahan)
- It can be characterized by increasing possible human choices. 
- Human Development is focused on enlarging the choices we have in daily life.
- The capabilities of a human being need to be enhanced.
- Human capabilities => Opportunity to use those capabilities.
- If this is mismatched, it results in frustration.
- Human development is the development of the people, for the people, and by the people. 
- Income is a critical ingredient for development. 
- Human development is much more holistic than human resource development.
- The Human Development Index (HDI). Everyone wants to find the ranking of their country and where their competitor is. 
- In Human Development measurement there are two main measures. 
- Breadth (different indicators, dashboard-like).  
- Focused measure (HDI), concentrates on three basic dimensions. Long healthy life, knowledge, and standard of living. 
- Breadth measure is like a house, focused is like a door. 
- Don't mistake the door to be the house. 
- Rethinking 'work' for human development.
- Non-job related work is important for human development and the interconnectedness of people.
- We know that women are the majority of care work. 
- The agricultural sector makes up most of the workers in the world.
- Work during crisis/post-crisis is important. Must continue to think about putting food on the table. 

### Ted Talk (Hans Rosling)
- An example that we are all subject to potentially preconceived ideas that shape our perceptions of the world. 
- The world has changed very drastically since 1962, with the majority of families getting smaller and living longer. 
- Aid does not usually consist of countries with lots of money giving to less fortunate ones. 
- Logarithmic sort of distribution for dollars per day in the world. 
- Nearly linear correlation between money and child survival rate. 
- Need health before wealth for growth.
- Gapminder connects the public to usually difficult to access data.
