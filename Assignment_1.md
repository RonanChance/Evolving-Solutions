## Problem Statement:
There are a number of necessary requirements for effective urbanization and infrastructure, particularly in the development of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The impacts that negligence and lack of planning have on average lifespan is well documented, along with the negative implications of air and water pollution. The chosen research papers and studies were conducted with the goal of understanding what constitutes effective development and to assess what the country of Mongolia can do to further improve the quality of life for its citizens. A dedication to Amartya Sen’s perspective of development is precisely what will propel Mongolia forward. While the GDP has seen substantial improvements over the past decade, emphasis on social services and improved living conditions are a necessity for continued development. If Ulaanbatar can incorporate a dedication to the Sustainable Development Goals for the next chapter of growth, the country has the potential to successfully transition into the modern world. 

Having lived in Ulaanbaatar from 2010 to 2013, I fully appreciate the need for development. During my stay, I witnessed the terrible pollution and even how a 20 minute drive out of the city would result in starkly cleaner air. The roadways were underdeveloped, and the mass influx of imported vehicles caused large disturbances and traffic jams. I loved living in Mongolia, the sprawling land and blue sky shaped my childhood, and it is for this reason that it will always have a place in my heart. For these same reasons, I desired to research the variety of developmental aspects that are most pertinent and to better understand what can be done to optimize future success.

1. Tsutsumida, N., Saizen, I., Matsuoka, M., &amp; Ishii, R. (2015). Addressing urban expansion using feature-oriented spatial data in a peripheral area of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.01.024

This case study was conducted in a fringe area of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The researchers sought to identify the geographical factors that were most important in the development of the city. This is a necessary research project because as of now, city growth has occurred naturally and without forethought or planning. In fact, nomads were able to simply claim land by building a wooden fence until land reform laws took effect in the early 2000s. To achieve this analysis, and between the years 2003 and 2008, photographs were taken of the area before being digitized into vector formats. These high-resolution satellite images allowed the analysis of surfaces much more closely. Very High Resolution (VHR) data could be used in coordination with imaging software to marked areas as either Main Roads, Roads, or Private Land. Using the data collected over the timespan, logistic regression models were then used to evaluate the continued urban expansion. These models have been quite effective in the prediction of urban expansion. That being said, they are not without fault, and the researchers included random sampling to reduce the sampling so that no spatial autocorrelation resulted from the data.  What the researchers found the land plots were more likely to be built near land that was occupied and near water kiosks (or any other social services). 

When failures in land management occurred, this spurred an increase in gers and fringe area growth. This resulted in an overall degradation in living standards.  Surprisingly, however, there was little correlation found between topographical indicators like slope or elevation of the land. Using the obtained data, prediction methods were then utilized to find areas that were most likely to further develop and expand. 

With this knowledge, the researchers proposed a call to action to all urban planners stating that they “should act preemptively to manage any potential future side effects of expansion”. Amartya Sen's places a heavy emphasis on the social aspects of a healthy and productive existence. This data could be utilized to benefit future expansion efforts and give people more consistently reliable access to water and other social benefits. As seen in the Sustainable Development Goals, sustainable cities and communities (goal 11) and industry, innovation and infrastructure (goal 9) are necessary for the satisfactory development of a city. The researchers sought to find an effective means of predicting city growth, and these findings, if used effectively, could be a means of drastically improving the quality of life in the city.

This study sought to show the adverse health effects of air pollution in Mongolia. The utilization of land regression modeling and mobile monitoring allowed for more intricate analysis of the air quality. NO2 and SO2 were the two main pollutants and were closely monitored over two years. Population growth in the Ulaanbaatar city has resulted in massive increases in emissions. Much of the population still lives in gers where coal, wood, and sometimes dung, are burned for the sake of heating. Moreover, leaded gasoline is still legally distributed in Mongolia which further adds to the pollution issue. The topography of the area also results in extremely high concentrations of pollution during the colder months. This is because the entire area is surrounded by large topographical increases which result in much pollution being concentrated on the city. 

The objectives of this study were to analyze the pollutant concentration patterns and to see if there existed any correlations between pollution and mortality in the community. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mappers (ETM), and even OpenStreetMap to collect data. Even cars driving predetermined routes collecting data were used for the mobile monitoring portion of data collection. The data showed that concentrations of NO2 were heaviest during winter months and near major roads in the city center. The monitored particulate matter concentrations place Ulaanbaatar as one of the most polluted cities in the world. 

Pollution and temperature correlated strongly which matches the increase in necessary burning of wood, coal, and dung for heat. The concentrations of NO2 and SO2 were around 7-8 times the World Health Organization’s guidelines. The results were comparable to wintertime results in Beijing and Shanghai. The goals of the study were to characterize pollution and temporal patterns in a developing country while also monitoring mortality rates. Results showed intensely unhealthy results that are directly resulting in potentially postponable deaths. To make the city considerably more sustainable, working to reduce pollution and air particulate matter is necessary. When I lived in Ulaanbaatar, there was a concerted effort on behalf of the United Nations to provide aid efforts that would directly help low-income families heat their gers in more sustainable ways. Good health and wellbeing is the third sustainable development goal and is one of the major factors hindering the success of the city.

This study seeks to elucidate how the low density settlements are evolving and collected satellite data from 1986 to 2000. The accelerated urban growth in Ulaanbaatar is hypothesized to be a result of people responding to the new market oriented economy. To make an efficient study, remote sensing (satellite imaging) was used to classify areas of the city into one of five different classifications and eight surface categories. This sorting was helpful in accurately quantifying the data. Due to this study collecting data over the span of 16 years, sensing technology improved drastically from Spot XS with low resolution to extremely high resolution Aerial photography. Upon looking at the statistical analysis, all parts of the city did increase. However, the ger areas saw the most drastic increase from 35.6% to 45.9%. In fact, the study concluded that the majority of the growth occurred in the mountainous and sloped regions to the north of the city center. 

As is already well understood, the connection between sustainable communities (goal 11) along with infrastructure (goal 9) is deeply related to the well being of citizens. One of the conclusions drawn from the study was that it became difficult to classify the variety of newer buildings because of their varying shapes and sizes. What was most interesting about this research project was the variety of technology used to collect data. The research was also effective in then taking the collected information and synthesizing a map to classify the different areas of the city and monitor the growth over time. Overall, the study resulted in a better understanding of how land use is correlated with city expansion.

Water quality is generally reflective of the surrounding area and the kind of development that has occured. While Mongolia is a landlocked country, it does have a number of waterways. This study was conducted through the use of 72 monitoring stations on 35 rivers. Ammonium content was quite high in the northern rivers. This is almost assuredly correlated with the agricultural lifestyle that exists in these areas. The Tuul river that runs through Ulaanbaatar is the most polluted of all and has exhibited a significant decrease in quality between 1980 and 1990. 

The researchers suggested that future studies continue to monitor the water quality, and recommended that database systems in coordination with GIS would be an effective way of continued evaluation. Moreover, quality assurance and control programs should be implemented with an overall increase in proper policies to preserve the future cleanliness of the waterway. The environmental impacts that urbanization and industrialization have are significant, and part of sustainable development is understanding how to mitigate the negative effects we exert on the world around us.

Quality of life is a result of a vast number of factors. Understanding public sentiment with their residential situation is important in quantifying the necessity for development. Ulaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world, and the majority of people are living in gers (these are the traditional felt houses that can be dismantled and reassembled within a few hours). Mostly, this is a result of necessity. Ulaanbatar itself comprises 0.3% of the land area of the country of Mongolia, yet it houses 45% of the population. This study seeks to understand the satisfaction levels of people living in the ger districts. 

To achieve this research, a survey consisting of 33 questions was administered to 112 households in 2011. From this basic scientific process, much was learned about the individuals and families that live in these districts. In fact, 48% of them were nomads before living in the area. Surprisingly, a staggering 79% of respondents were the owners of the piece of land they resided on. As it turns out, due to Mongolia’s low population density, one of the benefits of being an inhabitant is that you are granted a free piece of land. The parts of the survey most pertinent to satisfaction levels showed that about a third of people were unsatisfied, a third were averagely satisfied, and a third were happy with their current situation. This is an intriguing find, as one would imagine their current conditions to be quite displeasing to the vast majority of individuals living in developed countries, especially considering that most of these respondents live in areas without real streets or sanitary services. 

The future of Mongolia appears as though a large amount of urbanization and development are in sight. The majority of residents would be happy to live in an apartment and to move out of a ger, and the influx of mining operations has given rise to a growing GDP. The environment is at the most risk due to the fossil fuel increase and poor urban planning that allows for systemic pollution. However, with the correct policies and procedures in place, Mongolia looks to be an emerging success story of development.
