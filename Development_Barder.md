Who was Steve Jones and what did he do at unilever?
Steve Jones is an evolutionary biologist that was hired by Unilever to design a better soap nozzle. The process requires crystalizing soap that falls out of the nozzle. The issue was that the process was quite inefficient. Steve Jones took a different approach to the design of a new shape of nozzle. He first generated 10 random ones, tested them, and chose the best one for further adaptations. Repeating the process and 45 generations later created one hundreds of times more efficient (as compared to a usual 20% increase from redesigns). This is a showcase of adaptive change being applied to everyday life that causes game-changing results. 

## Acemoglu and Robinson why nations fail. Engineer prosperity by providing the right advice. (8)
They argued that mainstream development practice today is built on incorrect assumptions. We assume that poor countries are poor because their rulers have mistaken views of how to run their country: they prevent markets from working properly and they tolerate corruption. Poor countries do not have weak institutions because they do not know any better, but because it suits the powerful elites to run things this way. Long line of books which spends a lot of time saying that everyone before them was wrong, and that there is some missing ingredient which would make things right.

Economic systems are not like economic systems - they are one in the same. 

## Notes from Podcast

How we have modelled economies and growth have given rise to fruitless quests for the missing ingredient which will enable poor countries to grow. 

Young Woman from Gojam, Ethiopia wants to be a doctor. 

Amartya Sen defines development as “enlarging people's choices, capabilities and freedoms, so that they can live a long and healthy life, have access to knowledge, a decent standard of living, and participate in the life of their community.” 

Thwaites wanted to make a toaster from scratch. It turned out to be extremely difficult to make just a simple $5 toaster. We learn that the economy has to be sufficiently sophisticated and rich to be able to supply all these different materials and parts 

Walter Rostow published The Stages of Economic Growth which claimed that development is a virtuous circle: when investment rises, that means that the capital stock rises, so output rises, leading to higher incomes, more savings, and so more investment.

Theory that if you could increase investment by 5 or 10 per cent of national income this would trigger this virtuous circle and launch the country into ‘self‐sustained growth’. Once you know the investment you need to get lift off, you can calculate the amount of foreign aid that is needed to fill the gap.

World bank still uses this model to decide donations. 

Neoclassical model introduced a third component called "technical change". When combined with labor and capital increasing the output of both firms. 

Divergence between rich countries and poor countries is entirely explained by the fact that sub‐Saharan Africa has had negative growth in this unexplained ‘technology’ component, while the countries of East Asia, for example, have had positive growth.

Washington Consensus reforms. Efforts to free up markets unfortunately did not lead to convergence of poor countries on the industrialised world in the ways that were supposed to. 

Ajaoukuta has so far produced no steel at all despite costing 5 billion dollars to the US. 

The UK spends 1/5 of its budget on governance. 

Development cooperation is based on the notion that we should try to engineer prosperity by providing the right advice and by convincing politicians of what is good economics. However, poor countries do not have weak institutions because they do not know any better, but because it suits the powerful elites to run things this way.

The last fifty years has been the most successful period in history in reducing poverty, increasing incomes, getting children into school, improving life expectancy, reducing hunger and malnutrition, and increasing access to clean water. 

Steve Jones used random distortion through generations to create a new, much more efficient nozzle.

80% of productivity improvement does not come from within firms, but from the creative destruction process in which old firms go bust, and then they are replaced by new firms which are better adapted to today’s environment. 

You can see that there is this constant process of adaptation changes in physical technologies, people’s behaviour, business plans and firms, social institutions, the environment in which we live – all changing in response to each other.  

We have typically ignored the obvious truth that the economy they are trying to model is complex and non‐linear. 

I am going to list five important feature of complex adaptive systems: First, they are all difficult or impossible to predict in detail. Second, you can make broad brush predictions about the system as a whole. Third, complex adaptive systems have emergent properties. Fourth, complex adaptive systems tend towards greater complexity. And fifth, these systems do not tend towards an equilibrium. 

Incentives like natural resources actually end up serving the elites and not benefiting the society as a whole. However, these things are also essential to development.

It is difficult to engineer solutions to complex biological problems.
We should try to harness the power of the evolutionary process.

Isomorphic mimicry. We cannot just make institutions that camoflage as effective. 

We must resist fatalistic ideologies and own up to life. 

People on the right tend to focus on the need for innovation and selection to accelerate evolution, but they pay too little attention to the need for society to shape its direction. 

People on the left tend to pay too much attention to the need to determine the destination in which the process is heading and pay too little attention to nurturing the dynamism and creative value of the evolutionary process. 

The sixth policy conclusion is that we should explicitly embrace the idea of greater experimentation as a component of the development process.
