## Note for week 3 of class

### What is human development? (Selim Jahan)
- It can be characterized by increasing possible human choices. 
- Human Development is focused on enlarging the choices we have in daily life.
- The capabilities of a human being need to be enhanced.
- Human capabilities => Opportunity to use those capabilities.
- If this is mismatched, it results in frustration.
- Human development is the development of the people, for the people, and by the people. 
- Income is a critical ingredient for development. 
- Human development is much more holistic than human resource development.
- The Human Development Index (HDI). Everyone wants to find the ranking of their country and where their competitor is. 
- In Human Development measurement there are two main measures. 
- Breadth (different indicators, dashboard-like).  
- Focused measure (HDI), concentrates on three basic dimensions. Long healthy life, knowledge, and standard of living. 
Breadth measure is like a house, focused is like a door. 
- Don't mistake the door to be the house. 
- Rethinking 'work' for human development.
- Non-job related work is important for human development and the interconnectedness of people.
- We know that women are the majority of care work. 
- The agricultural sector makes up most of the workers in the world.
- Work during crisis/post-crisis is important. Must continue to think about putting food on the table.
