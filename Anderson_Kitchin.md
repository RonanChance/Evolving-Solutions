Anderson's article proclaiming the death of scientific theory is initially a compelling read. I believe it to be addressing a very true and fascinating phenomenon, and while initially agreeing with his viewpoint, reading Kitchin's response gave me a more tempered view. I do believe that the truth is more along the lines of entering a new paradigm than the death of scientific theory. Much of our research processes have been disrupted by the sudden improvements in technology, but not in the way such that all our scientific processes are invalid. Now we have the capability of taking data and deriving meaning from it rather than first hypothesizing before proceeding with data collection. With this in mind, I do believe that data-driven science will be the "new paradigm" of big data analytics, and it will allow us to solve novel problems we may have never noticed we had or ones that have plagued us for millennia.
