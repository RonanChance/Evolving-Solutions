The authors use a technique to produce a high-resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The random forest algorithm works by using decision trees. Essentially it uses a certain amount of randomness to make a bunch of trees (a forest) and all these together are more accurate than a single tree. They specifically used a random forest nonparametric (not involving any assumptions as to the form or parameters of a frequency distribution), predictive model. This allowed them to weigh both remotely sensed and geospatial data. They also used Dasymetric Mapping to distribute their findings across areas (like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya). This is what creates the color-coded maps which show symbolically what we are studying.

The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithm adjust themselves as they are exposed to more data. Each piece of the data is used to alter or improve the understanding of the algorithm. The random forest approach relies more on prediction rather than explanation. Logistic regression modeling is standard for binary classification and when the number of covariates is small compared to the sample size. Random forest is also considered a black box algorithm.

In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

Land cover data, networks of roads and waterways, large water bodies, settlement locations, protected area delineations. This is all located in Table 1 where they show the different variables used for population density estimation. It seems as though the geospatial covariates represented quite large datasets, which is somewhat implicit in the concept of big data analytics. The significance here, or at least the implied theory, is that with more covariates and data we can make more accurate predictions. This is why the study incorporated so many different types of data, all with the goal of making the final prediction model as accurate and useful as possible. 


The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

When it comes to Low-Middle Income Countries, having an accurate understanding of population distribution is essential. These are often places that lack any sort of good census data, and this geospatially collected and high-resolution data can be used to serve the country immensely. This could be from a humanitarian aid perspective, as other countries know how to better help, or even just to the government itself. Now resources can be used to optimally help the most number of people possible, and infrastructure can be built according to the needs. 


Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

Understanding the distribution of individuals across Mongolia is helpful, however, some of the understanding already exists. Due to the way of culture, a vast amount of people live in Ulaanbaatar (around 45% of the total population). The rest of the population is likely nomadic and living spread out around the country. A routinely updated database of population distribution could help further the understanding of how nomads move, which could be used to potentially further infrastructure if there are patterns.
