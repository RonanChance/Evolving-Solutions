### Notes While Reading
- Development is the process of expanding freedoms
- Growth of GNP is important, but not the most important
- social modernization can substantially contribute to development.
- Development requires removing the sources of unfreedom, like poverty / tyranny / social deprivation / repressive states / etc. 
- Evaluative Reason: assessment of progress has to be done in terms of whether the freedoms that people have been enhanced.
- Effectiveness reason: the achievement of development is thoroughly dependent on the free agency of people.
- The presence of intergroup contrasts within richer countries can be seen to be an important aspect of the understanding of development.
- Hindu and Muslim conflicts caused the death of many. In the example illustrated in the reading, a man died because of economic unfreedoms that caused him to be in a dangerous and deadly situation. 
- Must acknowledge the role of social values and prevailing mores which influence the freedoms that people enjoy.
- 5 distinct types of freedom are analyzed in these chapters.

- The remarkable empirical connection that links freedoms of different kinds with one another. 
- Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else.
- There is little evidence to support that authoritarian politics actually helps economic growth.
- Economic growth seems to be a matter of friendlier economic climate actually.
- Unfreedoms can occur from inadequate processes or through inadequate opportunities.
- The two-way relationship between public policy and participatory public capabilities.
- The role of income and wealth has to be integrated into a broader and fuller picture of success and deprivation.
- We should see poverty as a deprivation of basic capabilities rather than merely as low income- undernourishment, morbidity, illiteracy, etc. 
- In the United States, African Americans as a group have lower chances of reaching advanced ages than do people born in immensely poorer economies. 
- A freedom-centered perspective has a generic similarity to the common concern with the quality of life which concentrates too much on the way human life goes and not just on the resources that person commands. 
- The discipline of economics has tended to move away from focusing on the value of freedoms to that of utilities, income, and wealth. 
- Individual freedom is a social product with a relation between social arrangements to expand individual freedoms and the use of individual freedoms to make social arrangements more effective.
- Participation is a key aspect of development at both the social and individual level.
- Even if you have no immediate interest in exercising a freedom, it is still necessary that it exists. 
- Availability and access to finance can be a crucial influence on the economic entitlements that economic agents are able to secure. 
- Some of the real handicaps that China experiences are because of a lack of democracy. Conversely, there does exist different sorts of handicaps in both types of governmental systems.
- Impacts of economic growth depend much on how the fruits of economic growth are used.

- The ends and means of development call for placing the perspective of freedom at the center of the stage. 
- People must be given the opportunity to shape their own destiny and not be passive recipients. 
- State and society have the role of safeguarding human capabilities.
